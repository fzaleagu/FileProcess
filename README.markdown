# ePub Checker

This is a Mac app to allow a quick and easy way for a "normal" user to run a bunch of files through [epubcheck](http://code.google.com/p/epubcheck/).

If you select a directory, if will recursively search it for all ePub files. You can also select one (or multiple) files.

Output from epubcheck will be shown in the built-in console, but you can also save the log to disk.
